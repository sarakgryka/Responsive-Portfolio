                <p>My name is Sara Gryka. I am a creative dreamer working on becoming a web developer. I love problem
                    solving and new challenges, so bring them my way!
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    I am happily married and a fur mom to two big dogs,
                    that are actually just huge babies. I am originally from Michigan and miss the summers especially when
                    we
                    are
                    fighting the summer heat here in Arizona. Most of our family is still back in the midwest, but we
                    have
                    found a new home here in Arizona. I don't know if we will ever get used to the desert, but we sure
                    do
                    love the sunshine!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Some of my favorite things to do are travel, hike, and just get out into nature and enjoy! I love
                    music
                    and am always listening to something.
